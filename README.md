# SocialTetrahedrons
Mark Frazier's Social Tetrahedrons prototyped in Three.js

# Status

This is an attempt to do some rapid prototyping to implement Mark's concept of Social Tetrahedrons.
The basic idea is to represent 4 dimension: mind, body, spirit, for example, in combination with
level in a need hierarchy, for example.

I'm starting with code we used in the 2018 Public Invention Mathathon, and attempting to
hack it as quickly as possible into something resembling Mark's concept. Conceptually,
this is all due to Mark Frazier.

Basically, this is a Three.js, all-browser, serverless implementation. We may add a durable
database later.
